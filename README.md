Capstone Project for DataScience  Part3
The segmenting and clustering of the neighborhoods in the City of Toronto, Canada, using BeatifulSoup, FourSquare APIs, and KMeans
Krishna Yellamilli 06/30/2020
On top of parts 1 and 2, which used BeatifulSoup to scrape the Wikipedia for the postal codes, boroughs and neighborhoods info, created a base DataFrame, and combined that DataFrame with latitude and longitude information, I gathered venues, using the FourSquare APIs, in 500m radius of postal codes and overlaid them over Folium map for visualization. Using the KMeans, I clustered the venues into 5 clusters and overlaid them on a new Folium map for visualization and analyzed the characteristics of the clusters.
